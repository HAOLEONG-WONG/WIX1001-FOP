------------------------------------
##Since I am coding this code with different classes in the same package, you would need to import the class( but I have already imported all the method in the class in the coding)
##So make sure the class is using the same name as mine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are all the coding part only 
If you are trying to execute this part, you can follow the steps below:
1) Create and copy the .txt file.
2) Make sure the .txt file is located the same as your coding part
-By running CheckingFilesintheCurrentDirectory, you can check whether it is the same or not
3) Create a new class and copy the ReadFilesintoArrays, to read the contents in the .txt file
4) Create a new class and copy the ParseClubData, to parse all the clubs in the ClubSocieties.txt
5) Create a new class and copy the MatchUserClubs, to match user in UserData.txt with clubs in the ClubSocieties.txt
6) Create a new class and copy the CategorizeandDisplay.The purpose of this class is to display the result.
7) Create a new class and copy the main, to combine all the methods in these classes and finally show all the results.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##In all these classes, I have created an optional output to check whether my coding is functional.
