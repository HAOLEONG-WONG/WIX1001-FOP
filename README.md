###How to run this part?

1)Create and copy the txt.file.
2)Create and copy the class called CheckingFilesintheCurrentDirectory and run it.TO ensure the .txt is using the same directory as the code.
3)Create and copy the class called FileReadAndAppend and run it. It will append the user input to the ActivitiesLog.txt.

-The method readFromFile is to read the .txt file

-The method appendToFile is to append the user input to the .txt

-The method transferinfoToString is to convert user info to String so that it can be append into .txt file. (optional, since the userinput is already in string format)

-The program output is optional, just to check whether the code is functional or not.
